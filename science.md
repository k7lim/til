# Stuff I learned from reading An Immense World by Ed Yong
* All life that can see descended from the same organism. (Yong points to Megan Porter's research.
  * in a earlier paper, Porter and Thomas Cronin state "All opsins, invertebrate and vertebrate, derive from a common ancestral G-protein-coupled receptor" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289648251_The_Evolution_of_Invertebrate_Photopigments_and_Photoreceptors)

* Octopi is NOT technically the right plural for Octopus, because Octopus is from Greek, not Latin! Octopuses or Octopodes
